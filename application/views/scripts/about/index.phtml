			<p>An Arizona native, Dakota was raised in an environment where functional fitness is a way of life. Mountain biking, rock climbing and hiking were regular activities during his upbringing, which ignited a passion for active living at an early age. As involved as Dakota was with outdoor sports, he battled with wellness throughout adolescence. Nearly reaching 275 lbs as a Freshman in high school, Dakota made the decision in 2002 to take control of his health and with the help of his trainer & mentor, he successfully lost over 60 lbs..
